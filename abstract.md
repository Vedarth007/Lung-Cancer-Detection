Problem Statement:  Artificial Intelligence-Enhanced Lung Cancer Staging: A Step Towards Precision Oncology.

Lung cancer remains a significant global health concern. Accurate and timely staging is crucial for optimal treatment planning and prognosis. Traditional staging methods, often relying on manual image analysis and clinical data, can be time-consuming and prone to inter-observer variability.

Dataset Used: This study leverages the power of artificial intelligence (AI) to improve lung cancer staging. By utilizing a large-scale lung cancer dataset from Kaggle, consisting of annotated CT scans and clinical data, we aim to develop an AI-powered system capable of automatically analyzing medical images and accurately predicting cancer stages.

Our proposed AI model will employ advanced deep learning techniques, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), to extract relevant features from CT images. Combined with clinical information, these features will be fed into a machine-learning model to predict the stage of lung cancer.

This AI-driven approach has the potential to improve patient outcomes, reduce diagnostic errors, and facilitate timely treatment decisions by automating the staging process and enhancing its accuracy.
